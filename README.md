The Large Language Model efficiently locates the most relevant documents, extracting precise answers directly from the provided documents, thereby saving time and enhancing information retrieval.
In the process we have done Data Loading, Document Chunking, Vector Stores, and Text and Embedding model interaction, highlighting its multifunctional role in diverse aspects of data processing and analysis.
Tech Used: LangChain,Vector Database(Matching Engine),Python,PaLM 2 Model,Vertex Online Prediction(Model Endpoint)
